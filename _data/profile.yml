  <p>
    I am an Assistant Professor at Graduate School of Advanced Imaging Science, Multimedia & Films (GSAIM), Chung-Ang University, where I am leading Immersive Reality & Intelligent Systems Lab (IRIS LAB).
  </p>
  <p>
    Before joining Chung-Ang University, I was a postdoctoral researcher in School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC), a visiting postdoctoral researcher in Electrical Engineering at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, and a postdoctoral researcher in School of Electrical Engineering at KAIST, Daejeon, Korea. I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in School of Electronic Engineering at Inha University, Incheon, Korea, in 2012 and 2014, respectively. I received the Ph.D. degree in School of Electrical Engineering at KAIST, Daejeon, Korea, in 2019.
